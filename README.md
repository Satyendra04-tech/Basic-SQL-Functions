# Hello All, I am sharing Basic SQL Functions notes here  

1. **Select** = It is the most commonly used function and it allows us to retrieve information from a table.  

    * Syntax =` SELECT  **column_name** from **table_name** ;`
          
        `SELECT * from **table_name**` ; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : If we need all the columns from a table we can generally use *.  

2. **Select Distinct** = Sometimes a table contains a column that has duplicates values, so in this case we can use select distinct to list the unique values from the table.  

     * Syntax = `SELECT DISTINCT **column_name** from **table_name** ; `

3. **Count** = It returns the number of rows that are present in the given column of the table.  

     * Syntax = `SELECT COUNT (**column_name**) from **table_name** ;`  

         `SELECT COUNT (*) from **table_name** ;` then also we will get same results because number of rows will be same for all columns.  

## That's it for the basic SQL functions, see you in the next chapter !!
