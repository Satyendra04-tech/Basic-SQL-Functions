### Hello All, I am sharing Basic SQL Functions notes here  

1. **Select** = It is the most commonly used function and it allows us to retrieve information from a table.  

    * Syntax = SELECT  **column_name** from **table_name** ;  
        SELECT * from **table_name** ; : If we need all the columns from a table we can generally use *
